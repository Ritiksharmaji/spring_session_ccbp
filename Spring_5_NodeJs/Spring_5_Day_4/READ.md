We covered the following things in this unit:
1) Intro to MongoDB

2) Checking on the features & Implementation
## ----------------------------
while writting the code of backend in js we should to use the expression function not normal function or we  can use the arraow functon also.

Function Expression vs Function Declaration
Let‚Äôs formulate the key differences between Function Declarations and Expressions.

First, the syntax: how to differentiate between them in the code.

Function Declaration: a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow:

// Function Declaration
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
Function Expression: a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct. Here, the function is created on the right side of the ‚Äúassignment expression‚Äù =:

// Function Expression
let sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
The more subtle difference is when a function is created by the JavaScript engine.

## ---------------- Refactoring ----

### **What is Refactoring?**
Refactoring is the process of **rewriting and improving existing code** without changing its functionality. The goal is to make the code **cleaner, more efficient, and easier to maintain** while keeping its behavior the same.

---

### **Why Refactor Code?**
‚úÖ **Improves Readability** ‚Üí Makes code easier to understand.  
‚úÖ **Enhances Maintainability** ‚Üí Easier to update and fix bugs.  
‚úÖ **Boosts Performance** ‚Üí Removes redundant or inefficient code.  
‚úÖ **Reduces Complexity** ‚Üí Breaks down large, complicated code into smaller, reusable parts.  
‚úÖ **Removes Code Smells** ‚Üí Fixes bad coding practices that might cause issues later.  

---

### **Example of Refactoring**
#### **Before Refactoring (Messy Code)**
```javascript
function calculatePrice(price, tax) {
    if (tax === undefined) {
        tax = 0.1;  // Default tax is 10%
    }
    return price + (price * tax);
}
```

#### **After Refactoring (Cleaner Code)**
```javascript
const calculatePrice = (price, tax = 0.1) => price + price * tax;
```
üîπ **What changed?**  
- Used **default parameters** instead of a manual `if` check.  
- Used **arrow function** for a shorter and more readable syntax.  

---

### **Common Refactoring Techniques**
1. **Extract Function** ‚Üí Break a long function into smaller reusable functions.  
2. **Rename Variables** ‚Üí Use meaningful names to improve readability.  
3. **Remove Duplicate Code** ‚Üí DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.  
4. **Simplify Conditionals** ‚Üí Use ternary operators or switch statements.  
5. **Use Built-in Methods** ‚Üí Replace manual loops with `.map()`, `.filter()`, etc.  

---

### **When to Refactor?**
üîπ **Before adding new features** (to make it easier to integrate).  
üîπ **When debugging issues** (to simplify problem-solving).  
üîπ **After a code review** (to improve structure based on feedback).  

Refactoring helps keep your codebase **clean, efficient, and scalable!**

installl: npm install cors express mongoose dotenv morgan


### **What is `morgan` in Node.js?**  
`morgan` is a **logging middleware** for **Express.js** that helps track HTTP requests and responses in your Node.js application. It provides detailed logs about incoming requests, including method, status code, response time, and more.

---

### **üìå Why Use `morgan`?**
1. **Debugging**: Helps track request details for troubleshooting issues.  
2. **Monitoring**: Logs every API request, useful for analyzing API performance.  
3. **Security**: Helps detect suspicious activities (e.g., frequent failed login attempts).  
4. **Production Logs**: Stores logs for future analysis.  

---

### **üöÄ How to Use `morgan`?**
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install `morgan`**
Run this command in your project directory:
```sh
npm install morgan
```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Import and Use It in `server.js`**
```js
const express = require("express");
const morgan = require("morgan");

const app = express();

// Use morgan to log requests
app.use(morgan("dev")); // 'dev' is a pre-defined logging format

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, Morgan Logging!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

---

### **üìå Different Logging Formats in Morgan**
| Format  | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **dev** | Logs method, URL, status, response time (color-coded in the console). |
| **combined** | Standard Apache log format (good for production logs). |
| **common** | Similar to `combined`, but without referrer and user-agent. |
| **short** | Minimal logging format. |
| **tiny** | Logs only method, URL, and status code. |

#### **Example Usage**
```js
app.use(morgan("combined")); // More detailed logs, good for production
```

---

### **üìå Example Log Output (`dev` format)**
```
GET /api/user 200 10ms
POST /api/login 401 5ms
DELETE /api/product/123 204 12ms
```

---

### **‚úÖ Conclusion**
- `morgan` helps log API requests in a structured way.  
- Useful for debugging, performance monitoring, and security.  
- Easy to integrate with Express.js apps.

## -------------------------

### **What is `cors` in Node.js?**  
`cors` (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a **middleware** in Express.js that allows or restricts resources from being requested from another domain.  

By default, web browsers **block** requests from different origins (domains, protocols, or ports) for security reasons. The `cors` package helps enable cross-origin requests in your Express server.

---

## **üìå Why Use `cors`?**
1. **Prevents CORS Errors**: Without it, browsers block cross-origin requests.
2. **Allows API Access from Other Domains**: Essential for frontend-backend communication (e.g., React frontend calling an Express API).
3. **Improves Security**: Controls which domains can access your API.
4. **Handles Preflight Requests**: Supports `OPTIONS` method for preflight requests.

---

## **üöÄ How to Use `cors` in an Express App?**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install `cors` Package**
Run this command in your project directory:
```sh
npm install cors
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Import and Use It in `server.js`**
```js
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();

// Enable CORS for all requests
app.use(cors());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("CORS is enabled!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

---

## **üìå Custom CORS Configuration**
You can configure CORS to allow specific domains, headers, or HTTP methods.

### **‚úÖ Allow Requests from a Specific Origin**
```js
app.use(cors({
  origin: "https://example.com", // Only allow this domain
}));
```

### **‚úÖ Allow Multiple Origins**
```js
const allowedOrigins = ["https://example1.com", "https://example2.com"];

app.use(cors({
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error("Not allowed by CORS"));
    }
  },
}));
```

### **‚úÖ Allow Specific HTTP Methods**
```js
app.use(cors({
  origin: "*", // Allow all origins
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"], // Allow only these methods
}));
```

### **‚úÖ Allow Custom Headers**
```js
app.use(cors({
  origin: "*",
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
}));
```

---

## **üìå When to Use `cors`?**
- **Frontend-Backend Communication:** A React/Angular/Vue app calling an Express API.
- **Third-Party API Access:** When other websites need to access your API.
- **Cloud-Based Applications:** APIs deployed on services like AWS, Vercel, or Heroku.

---

## **‚ùå What Happens If You Don‚Äôt Use `cors`?**
If your frontend (React, Vue, etc.) makes a request to a different domain without enabling CORS, the browser will block it and show an error like:

```
Access to fetch at 'http://api.example.com/data' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' 
has been blocked by CORS policy.
```

---

## **‚úÖ Conclusion**
- `cors` is used to **allow or restrict** cross-origin requests.  
- Without it, browsers **block** API calls from different domains.  
- It can be configured to **allow specific origins, methods, and headers** for security.  
- Essential for frontend-backend communication in web applications.
