In Express.js, `app.use(express.json())` is a built-in middleware function that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads. This middleware is essential for handling JSON data sent in the body of HTTP requests, such as POST or PUT requests. citeturn0search2

**Purpose and Usage:**

When a client sends a request with a JSON body, Express doesn't parse this data automatically. By using `express.json()`, the JSON payload is parsed, and the resulting object is assigned to `req.body`. This allows you to access and manipulate the data within your route handlers.

**Example:**


```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  // Access parsed JSON data from the request body
  const { name, age } = req.body;
  res.send(`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```


In this example, when a POST request is made to `/data` with a JSON body like `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`, the `express.json()` middleware parses the JSON, and you can access `name` and `age` directly from `req.body`.

**Key Points:**

- **Availability:** The `express.json()` middleware has been available since Express version 4.16.0. citeturn0search2

- **Functionality:** It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on the `body-parser` library. citeturn0search2

- **Content-Type Header:** This middleware only parses requests where the `Content-Type` header matches the `type` option, which defaults to `application/json`. citeturn0search2

By incorporating `app.use(express.json())` into your Express application, you ensure that JSON data sent in request bodies is automatically parsed and accessible, facilitating the handling of structured data in your routes.
